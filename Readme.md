A **ReferenceError** is thrown when a non-existent variable is referenced.

A **TypeError** means that the code is trying to perform an operation on a value that is not of the expected type.

**null** is a special value in JavaScript that represents the absence of a value. 
This can happen when you try to access a property of an object that doesn't exist.
